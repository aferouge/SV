\section{Model verification}

In section~\ref{sec:trans} the translations of the requirements are also
translated into $\mu$-calculus. From that it is trivial to transform that into
a mcf (mu-calculus formula) file which can be checked with the mCRL2 tools. For example the first
requirement of~\ref{sec:trans} is translated to:

\begin{verbatim}
[true* . commPreSign(off) . !commPreSign(on)* . commStopSign(on)]false
\end{verbatim}

After writing all the requirements into the mcf format we have found that all
the model satisfies all $\mu$-calculus formulas.
