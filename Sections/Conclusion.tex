\section{Conclusion and Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this report we describe the development of our model, made in mCRL2, for a bridge control system fulfilling basic safety requirements. Afterwards, this model has been successfully verified for meeting these requirements using the mCRL2 model checker. The model takes into account a bridge operator, who is allowed to perform any kind of commands at all times, and the individual instances of the bridge components. A recommendation for future work is to include the sensors of the components in order to deal with erronous signals and malfunctioning of the bridge.
