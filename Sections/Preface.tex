\section*{Preface}

This document holds a report describing our findings during the project of System Validation, course IN4387 of the Embedded Systems master.
The topic of the assignment is to
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item designing a safety control layer for a bridge system and
	\item check whether all safety requirements are satisfied by the model.
\end{enumerate}
%

Since the draft a lot has been improved the last few weeks. The from an
architecture with only seven states, and simple processes that communicated
with each other, and no external interaction was possible, the model has been
enhanced where at any time external actions are allowed. Of course some actions
need to be prevented to meet the requirements of a bridge, which is why a
safety layer was introduced. This safely layer accepts external interactions
and makes sure the actions are only accepted if it is safe to do so.
Furthermore the $\mu$-calculus and corresponding mcf verifications have been
updated and extended to correspond with the enhanced model.

Hopefully you will enjoy this report. In case of any questions, we would be
happy to answer them. Just send an email to one of us.
