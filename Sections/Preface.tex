\section*{Preface}

This document holds a report describing our findings during the project of System Validaton, course IN4387 of the Embedded Systems master.
The topic of the assigment is to
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item designing a safety control layer for a bridge system and
	\item check whether all safety requirements are satisfied by the model.
\end{enumerate}
%
As this is just a draft of the final report, we would like to acknowledge the fact that perhaps the report is still to be improved. Also, the model is still very simple. In the next two weeks, we will attempt to add more detail to the model.

Hopefully you will enjoy this report. In case of any questions, we would be happy to answer them. Just send an email to one of us.\\
