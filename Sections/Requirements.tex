\section{Global Requirements}
\label{sec:glob}

Using the Project Guide\footnote{J. J. A. Keiren, System Validation (IN4387)
Project Guide, VU University Amterdam, november 2013} as a source for the
desired behaviour, the following requirements are defined:

\subsubsection*{Opening the bridge}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Stop signs cannot be lit unless the pre lights are lit
	\item Barriers cannot be lowered unless the stop signs are on
	\item Bridge can only be unlocked when all barriers are down
	\item The deck can only lifted when both locks are disengaged
	\newcounter{enumTemp}
	\setcounter{enumTemp}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Closing the bridge}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{\theenumTemp}
	\item Bridge can only be locked when the deck is down
	\item Barriers can only be raised when the bridge is locked by at least one
	      lock
	\item Stop sign cannot be shut off only when the barriers are down
	\setcounter{enumTemp}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{\theenumTemp}
	\item The bridge should be able to be opened when a ship approaches
	\item The bridge should be able to close and barriers should in order to
	      let cars pass
	\item The second barrier encountered by the cars is lowered after
	      the first in order to enable cars to leave the bridge
	\setcounter{enumTemp}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Failure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{\theenumTemp}
	\item The stop signs can only be lit if at least one pre sign is lit at
	      each side of the bridge
	\item The barriers can only be lowered if both stop signs are lit at each
	      side of the bridge
	\item If the motor is in the `broken' status, the bridge may not be opened
	\setcounter{enumTemp}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
