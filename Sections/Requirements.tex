N\subsection{Global Requirements}
\label{sec:glob}

Using the Project Guide\footnote{J. J. A. Keiren, System Validation (IN4387) Project Guide, VU University Amterdam, november 2013} as a source for the desired behaviour, the following requirements are defined:
\\
\\
\textbf{Opening the bridge}
	\begin{enumerate}
  	\item Switching on pre signs should be the first action when opening the bridge
		\item Stop signs cannot be lit as long as the pre lights have not been lit
		\item Barriers cannot be lowered if the stop signs have not been lit
		\item Bridge can only be unlocked when all barriers are down
		\item The deck can only lifted when both locks are unlocked
   \newcounter{enumTemp}
   \setcounter{enumTemp}{\theenumi}
 \end{enumerate}
  
\textbf{Closing the bridge}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{\theenumTemp}
  	\item Bridge can only be locked when the deck is down
		\item Barriers can only be up when the bridge is locked by at least 
		\setcounter{enumTemp}{\theenumi}
  \end{enumerate}
 
\textbf{Functional requirements}
	\begin{enumerate}
	
			\item The bridge should be able to be opened when a ship approaches
			\item The bridge should be able to close in order to let cars pass
			\item The first barrier to be encountered by the cars is lowered earlier than the second in order to enable cars to leave the bridge
		\setcounter{enumTemp}{\theenumi}
	\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Failure}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{\theenumTemp}
			\item The stop signs can only be lit if at least one pre signs is being lit at each side of the bridge
			\item The barriers can only be lowered if both stop signs are being lit at each side of the bridge
			\item If the motor is in the 'broken' status, the bridge may not be opened
		\setcounter{enumTemp}{\theenumi}
	\end{enumerate}
