n\subsection{Translation of Requirements in Terms of Interactions}

In order to create a model for the bridge in mCRL2, which is modeling software used for system validation, the requirements have to expressed in terms of the previous stated interactions. At the moment, we are still rewriting these translations after the feedback we received during last week's meeting. The following translations are from last week.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Stop signs cannot be lit as long as the pre lights have not been lit}
	When setSign is set on for all stop-signs, then check for all pre-signs if getSign is on before, and not off intermediate.
	Else when setSign is set on for all stop-signs, then check for three pre-signs if getSign is on before, and not off intermediate.
	Else, give error and stop.

	\item \textbf{Barriers cannot be closed if the stop signs have not been lit}
	When setBarrier is set down for all barriers, then check for all stop-signs if getSign is on before, and not off intermediate.
	Else when setBarrier is set down for all barriers, then check for three stop-signs if getSign is on before, and not off intermediate.
	Else, give error and stop.

	\item \textbf{Bridge can only be unlocked when all barriers are down}
	When setLock is set unlocked for all locks, then check for all barriers if getBarrier is down before, and not up intermediate.
	Else, give error and stop.

	\item	\textbf{The deck can only lifted when it is completely unlocked}
	When setDeck is set up for the bridge deck, then check for all locks if getLock is unlocked before, and not locked intermediate.
	Else, give error and stop.

	\item \textbf{Bridge can only be locked when the deck is down}
	Always when setLock(L2), then getDeck is down before, and not changed intermediately.
	Always when setLock(L1), then getDeck is down before, and not changed intermediately.

	\item \textbf{Barriers can only be up when the bridge is locked by at least one lock}
	Always when setBarrier(B, up), getLock(L1) or getLock(L2) are enabled, and not disabled intermediately.

	\item \textbf{Stop sign can be shut off only when the barriers are up}
	Always when setSign(S, off), for each B1, B2, B3, B4, getBarier should be up before, and not changed intermediately.

	\item \textbf{The bridge should be able to be opened when a ship approaches}
	When giving the open command, somewhere in the process setDeck should be set to up.

	\item \textbf{The bridge should be able to close in order to let cars pass}
	When giving the close command, somewhere in the process setDeck should be set to down.

	\item \textbf{The first barrier to be encountered by the cars is lowered earlier than the second in order to enable cars to leave the bridge}
	Always when setBarrier(B2, down), getBarrier(B1) must be down or else the process is stopped. 
	Always when setBarrier(B3, down), getBarrier(B4) must be down or else the process is stopped. 

	\item \textbf{The stop signs can only be lit if at least one pre signs is being lit at each side of the bridge}
	Always when setSign(S1, on) or setSign(S2, on), at least one status of getSign(P1) or getSign(P2) must be on. If not, the process is stopped.
	Always when setSign(S1, on) or setSign(S2, on), at least one status of getSign(P1) or getSign(P2) must be on. If not, the process is stopped.

	\item \textbf{The barriers can only be lowered if both stop signs are being lit at each side of the bridge}
	Always when setBarrier(B1, down), getSign(S1) and getSign(S2) must be down. If not, the process is stopped.
	Always when setBarrier(B1, down), getSign(S1) and getSign(S2) must be down. If not, the process is stopped.

	\item \textbf{If the motor is in the 'broken' status, the bridge should stay in the current position}
	Whenever motorStatus has been changed to broken and has not changed back to stopped, moving up or moving down, no components may be set anymore.

\end{enumerate}
