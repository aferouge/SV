\section{Translation of Requirements in Terms of Interactions}
\label{sec:trans}

In order to create a model for the bridge in mCRL2, which is modeling software used for system validation, the requirements have to expressed in terms of the previous stated interactions. Then, in order to check our model in mCRL2, the requirements have to be written using $\mu$-calculus. During the project, these translations will be used for model checking and therefore constantly be revised.

Because the requirements often concern all individual objects of a specific component (sign or barrier), the variable \emph{i}$\epsilon \{$1,2,3,4$\}$ has been introduced. For example, the parameter \texttt{S$_i$} in the $\mu$-calculus covers all four stop signs being S$_1$, S$_1$, S$_1$ and S$_1$.
